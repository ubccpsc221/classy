# Fork Customization

This folder must contain at least one file `CustomStudentView.ts`. This file must contain one default class that extends `AbstractStudentView`. 

An optional file called `CustomAdminView.ts` containing a class that extends `AdminView` can also be added. 

Any number of subclasses can also be contained in this folder. These changes should ***NOT*** be pushed back to `classy/master`.
